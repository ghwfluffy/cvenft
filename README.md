# CVE Collectibles

**CVE**: Common Vulnerability & Exploits\
**Collectibles**: NFTs - Non-Fungible Tokens

## Background

Project to create a community of cyber security and web3 enthusiasts. Membership and governance is based around ownership of collectible NFTs that represent popular CVEs.

## Community

### Twitter

Find us on twitter [@CveCollectibles](https://twitter.com/CveCollectibles)

#### Twitter Spaces

Coming soon is a plan to host periodic twitter spaces where we discuss the latest news in cyber security, and specifically analyze any new exploits or publicized hacks.

### Discord

Follow and message on twitter for an invite to the Discord server.

### DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

Currently the project exists as an informal collection of users, but the goal is to move to a DAO that formalizes the governance and participation of the community.

## NFT Collection

The NFT collection can be seen on [OpenSea](TODO).

### Traits

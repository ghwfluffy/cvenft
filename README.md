# CVE Collectibles

**CVE**: Common Vulnerabilities & Exploits\
**Collectibles**: NFTs - Non-Fungible Tokens

## Background

Project to create a community of cyber security and web3 enthusiasts. Membership and governance is based around ownership of collectible NFTs that represent popular CVEs.

## Community

Be one of the first to join the community. No NFTs have been minted so the first members to join and help grow the community will get on the ground floor and decide what CVEs are minted and how they will be distributed.

### Twitter

Find us on twitter [@CveCollectibles](https://twitter.com/CveCollectibles)

#### Twitter Spaces

Coming soon is a plan to host periodic twitter spaces where we discuss the latest news in cyber security, and specifically analyze any new exploits or publicized hacks.

### Discord

Follow and message on twitter for an invite to the Discord server.

### DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

Currently the project exists as an informal collection of users, but the goal is to move to a DAO that formalizes the governance and participation of the community.

## NFT Collection

The NFT collection will not be minted until enough community buy in.

### Traits

CVE Collectible NFTs are tagged with the following traits. Traits are intended to provide a sort of categorization and rarity ranking.

| Trait | Description |
| :---: | :---: |
| CVE | The CVE number assigned by MITRE |
| Exploit Type | The type of exploit:<BR/>Arbitrary Code Execution<BR/>Remote Code Execution<BR/>Privilege Escalation<BR/>Sensitive Data Exposure<BR/>Denial of Service |
| CVSS | The CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) Score<BR/>CVSS 3.x (or 2.x if 3.x unavailable)<BR/>From 0.1 (Low) to 10.0 (Critical) |

### Minting

NFT holders vote in the 'conference' room on Discord on which new CVEs should be minted and the parameters of the auction or airdrop.

#### Address

For absolutely no reason other than for fun, the genkey application is creating cool wallet addresses that can be used to mint the NFT collections. The shortened address will be all numbers and mostly zeros like 0x00000...2200.
